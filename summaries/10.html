    The mean MHI is 
    $63,311.91, while the median is slightly lower at $60,938, indicating a skew toward higher incomes. 
    Loudoun County, Virginia, has the highest MHI at $170,463, reflecting its status as part of the affluent 
    Washington, D.C., metropolitan area. Conversely, Issaquena County, Mississippi, reports the lowest 
    MHI at $17,900, highlighting severe economic challenges in parts of the rural South.

    Regional trends show a clear divide between wealthier urban or suburban areas and economically 
    struggling rural regions. For instance, counties in Northern Virginia, such as Fairfax County 
    ($133,974), dominate the upper end of the spectrum, benefiting from proximity to federal government 
    employment and high-paying tech industries. Similarly, counties in the San Francisco Bay Area, 
    like Santa Clara County ($140,258), rank among the highest, driven by the tech sector.

<p>
    In contrast, rural counties in the Deep South and parts of Appalachia consistently report lower MHIs. 
    Counties in Mississippi, Alabama, and West Virginia frequently fall below $40,000, with limited 
    economic opportunities and higher poverty rates contributing to these disparities. For example, 
    Clay County, Kentucky, has an MHI of just $24,028, underscoring persistent economic challenges 
    in the Appalachian region.

<p>
    These trends reflect broader economic divides across the U.S., shaped by access to education, job markets, 
    and regional industries. Addressing these disparities requires targeted economic development and policy 
    interventions tailored to the needs of underserved regions.
