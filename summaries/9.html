<p>New data from the U.S. Census Bureau highlights a significant disparity in median household incomes (MHI) across the nation’s Core-Based Statistical Areas (CBSAs), encompassing both metro and micro areas. The analysis of 927 CBSAs reveals a stark divide between the highest and lowest income regions.</p>

<p>The San Jose-Sunnyvale-Santa Clara, CA Metro Area, home to Silicon Valley, tops the list with a median household income of $151,713. It is followed by the Los Alamos, NM Micro Area ($135,801), and the San Francisco-Oakland-Berkeley, CA Metro Area ($129,315). These areas are well-known for their concentration of tech industries and high-paying jobs.</p>

<p>On the other end of the spectrum, the Middlesborough, KY Micro Area reports the lowest MHI at $33,658, alongside regions like Minden, LA ($34,263) and Bennettsville, SC ($34,275). These areas, predominantly rural, face economic challenges and limited access to high-wage employment opportunities.</p>

<p>Regional trends are evident in the data. The West Coast dominates the high-income bracket, driven by tech hubs and urban prosperity, while the Northeast also features prominently due to its mix of metropolitan areas and affluent suburbs. In contrast, the South and parts of the Midwest tend to have lower median incomes, with rural economies and smaller population centers contributing to the disparity. The Mountain West shows a mix of high and low incomes, reflecting the contrast between growing urban areas and more isolated rural communities.</p>
