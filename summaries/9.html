<h2>Understanding Median Household Income Across U.S. CBSAs</h2>
<p>Median household income is a crucial economic indicator that highlights financial well-being across different regions. This dataset provides insights into income distribution across various Core-Based Statistical Areas (CBSAs) in the United States, showcasing regional economic strengths and disparities.</p>

<h2>High-Income and Low-Income Regions</h2>
<p>At the top of the income spectrum is the <strong>San Jose-Sunnyvale-Santa Clara, CA Metro Area</strong>, boasting a median household income of <strong>$151,713</strong>. This region benefits from a high concentration of technology firms and skilled labor, resulting in significantly higher wages.</p>
<p>On the other end, <strong>Middlesborough, KY Micro Area</strong> records the lowest median income at <strong>$33,658</strong>. Many lower-income areas are characterized by smaller populations, limited economic diversification, and a higher dependency on industries that have declined over time.</p>

<h2>Regional Economic Trends</h2>
<p>Income levels tend to be higher in states with strong technology, finance, and government employment sectors. Areas such as <strong>Washington-Arlington-Alexandria, DC-VA-MD-WV Metro Area</strong> and <strong>Boston-Cambridge-Newton, MA-NH Metro Area</strong> reflect this trend with robust incomes.</p>
<p>Conversely, CBSAs in the Appalachian region, the Deep South, and parts of the Midwest tend to have lower median household incomes. States such as <strong>Mississippi, West Virginia, and Alabama</strong> feature several lower-income micro areas where economic challenges persist.</p>

<h2>Key Observations</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Technology and finance hubs command higher incomes:</strong> Regions like Silicon Valley and Washington, D.C. consistently outperform due to high-paying job markets.</li>
<li><strong>Cost of living plays a role:</strong> Although metro areas report higher incomes, higher living costs often offset financial advantages.</li>
<li><strong>Smaller metro areas with strong industries:</strong> Cities like Bloomington, IL, exhibit relatively high incomes due to stable industries and government employment.</li>
<li><strong>Rural areas lag:</strong> Many micro areas still struggle with lower wages, fewer job opportunities, and slower economic growth.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
<p>This dataset underscores the varying economic landscapes across the U.S. While some regions thrive with high-wage industries, others face financial challenges due to historical and economic factors. Understanding these trends helps contextualize broader economic discussions and regional prosperity.</p>
