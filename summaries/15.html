<h2>Overview of Poverty Rates in the United States</h2>
<p>
    Poverty rates across the United States reveal significant variation, ranging from a low of 7.2% in New Hampshire 
    to a high of 19.1% in Mississippi. The national median is approximately 12%, with the majority of states experiencing 
    poverty rates between 9% and 13%. This variation highlights notable disparities in economic conditions across regions.

<h2>Regional Trends in Poverty</h2>
<p>
    Southern states tend to have the highest poverty levels, with Louisiana (18.9%), Mississippi (19.1%), and West Virginia (16.6%) 
    among those most affected. These states continue to face longstanding economic challenges that contribute to elevated rates of poverty. 
    In contrast, states in the Northeast, including New Hampshire (7.2%), Massachusetts (10.0%), and Connecticut (10.0%), report some of the 
    lowest poverty levels, reflecting stronger economic conditions in that region.

<h2>Variations in the West and Midwest</h2>
<p>
    In the West, poverty rates are more varied. States such as Utah (8.6%) maintain some of the lowest rates in the country, 
    while others, like New Mexico (18.1%), experience some of the highest. In the Midwest, poverty levels are generally moderate, 
    with most states reporting rates close to the national average.

<h2>Addressing Economic Disparities</h2>
<p>
    The range in poverty rates underscores the economic inequality that persists across the country. Regions with higher poverty levels, 
    particularly in the South and parts of the West, highlight the need for targeted programs and policies to address these disparities 
    and support those most affected.
