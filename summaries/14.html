<p>The
population of U.S. counties varies widely, with some standing out as
major demographic centers. These counties, home to millions, play a
key role in driving economic and cultural growth but face unique
challenges tied to their size.</p>
<p>Los Angeles County, California, is the largest county by
population, with 10,014,000 residents—more than 40 states. Cook
County, Illinois, home to Chicago, ranks second with 5,275,000
people, serving as a Midwest economic powerhouse.</p>
<p>Harris County, Texas, anchored by Houston, comes in third with
4,589,000 residents, reflecting its booming energy sector and diverse
economy. Maricopa County, Arizona, which includes Phoenix, is close
behind with 4,485,000 residents, driven by rapid urbanization. San
Diego County, California, rounds out the top five with 3,347,000
people, benefiting from its coastal appeal and strong economic base.</p>
<p>California and Texas dominate the list, hosting several of the
largest counties. California’s Los Angeles and San Diego Counties
are joined by Orange and Riverside, while Texas boasts Harris,
Dallas, and Tarrant Counties as its key population hubs.</p>
<p>These large counties face growing challenges, including the need
for expanded housing, transportation, and public services. Balancing
these demands with sustainable growth requires careful planning and
investment.</p>
<p>As the largest counties grow, their influence on the nation
becomes more significant. Addressing their challenges is crucial to
ensuring their continued success and improving the quality of life
for millions of residents.</p>
